# Obsidian MacOS Last Tab

This plugin alters the behavior of closing a last Obsidian tab to match similar behavior of other MacOS apps. Similar to e.g. VS Code, when the last tab is closed, the window will be closed (whilst Obsidian is kept running for faster startup).

## Usage

-   Install plugin
-   Map CMD + W to the command `Close current tab or close window (if last tab)`
